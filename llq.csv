72,Lessons Learnt Details,Special Construction for circuit delivery is to be managed efficiently as this may delay the project schedule,Rahul Vijay <Rahul.Vijay@shell.com>,"<div><span style=""display:inline !important;"">It usually takes 6 weeks to get the ETA for Special Construction work from AT&amp;T once they place the order from their carrier. So, if the project require any special construction work it is best to wait for the timelines before committing any ETA to business as the timelines varies a lot and depends on the complexity of the work.&nbsp; This is experienced for one of the US site (WAS-SET). At the same time, it is important to know about the Special Construction work at the very early stage of the project by asking AT&amp;T to have the site survey completed. Also, it is important that we get the breakup of the cost for the special construction work. Please note, cost for any work that is required in the site premise has to be taken up by Business and any work required outside premise is a project cost. So, this is important we get a breakup of the cost and provide it to business and the project sponsor.</span><br></div>",New,11136,0,Special Construction related

to replace the Reliance connection but cannot guarantee diversity if we order a

to order a new, fully diverse, HA solution.

Secondly, the SPOF at the facility is also important as most of the times carrier do not highlight this requirement to set up a complete diversity. To set up a diversity at the site level, it is important to have 2 different entrance for the fiber run and this may require special construction within site premise and have additional cost.

As part of the design, the circuit handoff was of fibre type with LC-LC fibre connection requirement. As per initial design, AT&amp;T recommended that the new routers will not require SFPs transceiver as the existing SFPs on the current router can be used as these are still not end of life. However, trading support proposed that they would like to ensure that the new circuit and new routers are tested before the cutover and the circuit test activity is scheduled before the cutover. During circuit test, we identified that the new router did not had SFPs which is needed to connect the fibre to router and the activity had to be called off. AT&amp;T highlighted that the circuit testing was not part of the initial scope and hence the SFPs piece was just missed out before they planned for the circuit test activity.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now for circuit test, we needed a SFP and AT&amp;T highlighted that this procurement from AT&amp;T may take up to 3-4 weeks and will have additional cost of more than ~1,000 USD.

The engineer can also do some pre-checks for us before implementing the changes (i.e. view existing traffic on AT&amp;T devices such as firewalls to understand what rules we have to create) which is not possible without having a dedicated AT&amp;T engineer.
